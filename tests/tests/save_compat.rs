//! Save-format compatibility suite (SPEC §9: "Old saves must load forever").
//!
//! Every historical format version has a committed, byte-frozen fixture
//! here. Each must keep loading — through the migration pipeline — and
//! keep producing its recorded golden state, or the change that broke it
//! must ship a migration that makes it pass again. Regenerating a fixture
//! to make a red test green is forbidden without that migration.
//!
//! These suites load the FROZEN data snapshot (`fixtures/data_v6/`), never
//! the live `data/` directory, so balance edits cannot shift the goldens.
//!
//! Golden-hash policy (ADR 0004 §10): when a phase legitimately extends
//! the hash domain or the registration set, the same commit re-records the
//! goldens, says why, and proves content continuity (the persistence unit
//! tests `v*_fixture_content_survives_migration_verbatim` check migrated
//! bytes byte-for-byte). History: re-recorded in Phase 1 (event state
//! joined the hash), Phase 2 (+people registrations, format v3 —
//! ADR 0005 §9), Phase 3 (+world/AI registrations, format v4 —
//! ADR 0006 §8), Phase 4 (+economy registrations and events, format v5 —
//! ADR 0007 §9), and Phase 5 (+labor registrations and events, format
//! v6 — ADR 0008 §8; the pinned snapshot moved to `data_v6`, whose
//! balance and schedule changed this phase, so resume trajectories moved
//! with it).
